# Facial Emotions Detection

This project aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of seven categories, using deep convolutional neural networks and detecting human face using pre trained OpenCv Frontal face har-cascade. <br>
Dataset: fer2013 which is an open-source data set that was made publicly available for a Kaggle competition. It contains 48 X 48-pixel grayscale images of the face. There are seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral) present in the data.
